# TODO: Implement click functionality for .step elements in Riseup.php

- [x] Edit Riseup.php to add two more .image-item divs with different images (riseupprocess.png, riseupmenu.png, riseuplxp.png) and set display: none on all except the first.
- [x] Edit styles/style.css to add styles for hiding .image-item and active state for .step.
- [x] Edit scripts/script.js to add click event listeners on .step elements to show the corresponding .image-item and hide others, and add active class to the clicked .step.
- [ ] Test the functionality by running the page and clicking on steps.
