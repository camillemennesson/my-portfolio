# TODO for Adding Stamp Element to Homepage

## Steps from Approved Plan

- [x] Step 1: Edit index.php - Wrap the .intro section in a new .intro-container div and add a .stamp div after it with the text "I coded this site from scratch". This positions the stamp next to the intro.
- [x] Step 2: Edit styles/style.css - Add CSS for .intro-container (flex layout), .stamp (circular, rotated, bordered design), and @keyframes for animation (fade-in with scale/rotate). Include responsive adjustments for mobile.
- [x] Step 3: Test the changes - Use browser_action to launch localhost:8000, verify the stamp appears next to intro on desktop (with animation), below on mobile, no overlaps or errors.
- [x] Step 4: Update TODO.md - Mark completed steps and confirm final result.

Next steps after completion: If issues, iterate on styles; otherwise, attempt_completion.
