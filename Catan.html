            <p>Catan Universe is a board game adapted online 
                on web, steam and mobile platforms. I started 
                playing again during covid on the web browser 
                version. They launched a UI update 2.0 DURING 
                COVID lockdown.

                <h3>1. Invasive Welcome Screen</h3>
                <p>It’s been quite some time since I wanted to get back to Catan and play a few games. I’m welcomed on the landing page with an “Important Message” pop-up about Catan tournaments.
                
                <br>Here are the issues I found on this pop-up screen:
                <li> <b>Relevance.</b> I did not log-in for a long time, hence there’s a little chance I’ll be interested in tournaments</li>
                <li><b>White space.</b> I understand the intent for elegance and maintaining focus on the text and call-to-actions but, the message itself and the t-copy is poorly done</li>
                <li><b>Text copy & design.</b> Same style and color for every word, nothing stands out. If this is important information why not put it on this screen instead of redirecting users on the external Discord server.</li>

            For a strategic game like Catan, I really just need

                                         All the other elements can be hidden into the settings

                    The visual hints to understand what is currently happening
                     are too small and going too fast (the bottom left white text,

                     This is an issue since it’s critical information for this type of

                    (when it’s my turn or when exchanging with other players). 
                    Considering the size of the board, the number of other visual 
                    information and the pace of the game, it’s hardly impossible 
                    to quickly scan what types of cards I have in hand.

                             angry, cocky, or sarcastic (from what I interpreted). The worst
                              is “impatient” emojis from other players when It’s my turn and
                               I usually need to think in calm on what will be mly next moves.
